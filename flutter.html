                    <p>
                        (Due to a signed NDA, I'm not able show any code for this project)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For Research and Development paper we worked for a company called Bee Intelligence. The client
                        wanted to have a phone app for beehive owners to quickly and easily information on how their
                        employees and hives are going. All the information that needs to be displayed is already stored
                        on Bee Intelligence's servers. Our client wanted us to make a data object that he would fit his
                        data into and send to us. Then it is displayed in easy to read charts. This app was made using
                        the Flutter Framework. This meant that we can build the app in Android and iOS. This was a
                        requirement of our client. Since this was a big group project, I'll explain the parts I worked
                        on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, I created the data object that would store the information used by the chart. It was
                        important to get this object finished as soon as possible because it is a lot of work to change
                        things after the fact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A lot of peer-programming was done on the app as well. Most of the debugging for all the
                        features involved peer-programming. As well as the design implementation of the app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our client wanted the app to eventually have internationalization, so I started an implemenation
                        of langauge selection. For testing purposes the app can change between English and German. The
                        current language file is almost certainly incorrect German, however, the proof of concept is
                        there. It is designed for an easy addition of any language for Bee Intelligence's developers.
                        Each langauge has their own JSON file that is referenced for every string in the app. Changing
                        language simply changes which JSON file to retrieve the strings from. This is how Android handle
                        all their strings, however, this had to be implemented for a Flutter framework.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By default, when the app is closed and reopened again, settings like language, filters, sorting
                        aren't saved. I created a way for these settings to saved. This was done using the
                        SharedPreferences package, which implements SharedPreferences on Android and NSUserDefaults on
                        iOS. This was quite easy to set up. A SharedPreferences instance is created at the beginning of
                        running the app. This instance then reads all the values there previously saved using a key.
                        When a setting that should be saved changes, it is then saved into the SharedPreferences
                        instance using a key.
