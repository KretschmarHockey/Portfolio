    <h1>Status Posting System</h1>

    <p>What special features have you done, or attempted, in creating the site that we should know about?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The date is always formatted correctly due to the form date. Therefore there is no reason to test if it is
            formatted correctly.</li>
        <li>I also wasn't sure how to store the permissions. I decided to store it as a bitwise flag.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Which parts did you have trouble with?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I struggled to get the data from the radio buttons on the form.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What would you like to do better next time?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When the permissions are listed in the search page, I'd like to display it like a sentence:</li>
        <li>"Permissions: Allow Like, Comment and Share" as opposed to "Permissions: Allow Like Comment Share".</li>
        <li>"Permissions: Allow Like and Share" as opposed to "Permissions: Allow Like Share".</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What references/sources you have used to help you learn how to create your website?</p>
    <ul>

        <li>I upskilled a lot in php.</li>
        <li>I got a lot more comfortable using regular expressions.</li>
