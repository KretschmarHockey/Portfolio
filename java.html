                        My first side project was a problem that I wanted to solve. I have been the livestream director
                        for the Botany Swarm of the New Zealand Ice Hockey League. In 2018, I wanted to have my
                        livestream stand out as being the best games to watch in the country. So I decided to put my
                        programming skill to work. The thing that was lacking most from the watching the games was that
                        not enough information was being displayed to the viewer. So I designed some graphics to display
                        on stream. Due to the software used to livestream, I was limited to creating SVG graphics for
                        display. I then created a program that edits the SVG graphics to display the information
                        inputted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I got to use this software for all the home games at the Botany rink. The New Zealand ice hockey
                        community greatly appreciated the contribution I had to the livestream.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the same year I started making the software, the Canadian and American national ice hockey
                        teams came to play in the Spark Arena. Due to the software I created, I was asked to be the
                        livestream director for their game. That will always be memory I'll never forget, especially as
                        I got meet the players of both teams. I was also asked to be the livestream director for New
                        Zealand Winter Games in Queenstown. However, due to university commitments, I wasn't able to
                        attend.

                        The video below is recorded live footage of the software being used.

                        In the first clip the officials names are displayed underneath the scoreboard. These official
                        names are selected using the 'Officials' button. This then updates the officials graphic to
                        display the selected names.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first clip also shows the team lineups underneath the scoreboard. The lineup can be entered
                        using the 'Lines' button. This then updates 2 graphics. The one shown in the first clip, and the
                        graphic shown in the second clip.
                    </p>

                        The third clip shows the standings of the league. The graphic is updated automatically, with the
                        software collecting that information from a Hydra database maintained by the NZIHF.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fourth clip shows the player profile. The graphic can be changed to show whatever player is
                        selected on the main screen. When a New Zealand Ice Hockey League game is played it collects the
                        player's stats from a Hydra database maintained by the NZIHF. The clip shows it being used in
                        the USA vs Canada game. This information was collected from a database I was storing on the same
                        machine. I was manually updating the database during the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 'Nameplate' buttons allows you type in text for a nameplate to display on the screen. This
                        was used to introduce the singers of the national anthems. The 'Point Bar' button updates a
                        graphic showing the goal scorer and assists. The graphic is displayed underneath the scoreboard
                        like the lineups and officials. That information is collected from the Hydra database of the
                        live game stats.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to create software for the scoreboard as well. The one being used during the game is
                        licensed software. I was struggling to understand how threads worked at that time. I decided to
                        put that feature on hold. With another year of programming experience, I'm certain I'd be able
                        to solve it now.

                        Once I have more time to work on side projects, this project is 2nd on my list to complete. This
                        side project has helped me get a job for the Kelowna Rockets (from the Canadian Hockey League)
                        as a stats analyst. I am the first New Zealander to be working at this level of ice hockey.

                            For Computer Graphics Programming paper I designed a 3D model of an ice hockey player. This
                            was achieved by using free models online and reading them in using an OBJ file reader I
                            created. The spheres were drawn using OpenGL's method.
