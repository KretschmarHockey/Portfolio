                    <p>I created a playership that bounces around the screen. A green and red checkerboard is also
                        displayed at the top left. The center of each square has a blue line connecting with the
                        playership. Each of these objects can be hidden by
                        pressing 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The game object contains 3 booleans that determine whether an
                        object should be drawn. It is very important to make sure everything is being drawn in the right
                        order. I initially had the checkerboard
                        being drawn after/over blue lines.

                <div class="container">
                    <p>An issue I found with the spaceship movement is that the left joystick on the controller I’m
                        using doesn’t stay perfectly in the middle. This causes the ship to move, when the play probably
                        isn’t wanting it to move. To fix this, I
                        created a minimum limit that the joystick has to reach before it’ll move the ship.</p>

                    <p>While implementing Fmod, I wasn’t sure to have a sound handler class or to have everything coded
                        in the game class. The benefit of having a sound handler class is that it creates clear
                        divisions of functionality. If sound within the
                        game needs to be changed, a sound handler class will be easier to focus on. I thought for this
                        project though, since the sound system is very simple and direct, I decided to code everything
                        in the game class.

                <div class="container">
                    <p>I wanted the standard enemy ships to look like a human could make the moves. I wanted sudden
                        change in directions sometimes. The algorithm design I went with separates the X and Y
                        coordinates when it is being processed.</p>
                    <p>A random X and Y coordinate is generated as well as a random X and Y velocity. The enemy ship
                        then travels to the coordinates at the velocity. Due to the fact that the coordinates and
                        velocity is random, the enemy ship can arrive at
                        the X coordinate before it arrives to the Y coordinate. If this happens, the enemy ship stays at
                        that X coordinate, until the Y coordinate is reached. Once the X and Y coordinates are reached,
                        then a random X and Y coordinate and
                        X and Y velocity is generated again.</p>

                    <p>The menu contains 4 buttons that can be scrolled through with the D-Pad. I struggled to find out
                        how to implement the D-Pad as I didn’t know it was called a hat. Once I figured that out, it was
                        very easy to implement. The Menu object
                        contains a selected enum that corresponds to one of the buttons. This allows for the menu to
                        know which button is selected.</p>

                        rectangle would remain black. I spent
                        an hour trying to solve the problem. I ended up just having the text be white and turn green.

                <div class="container">
                    <p>I created a Scoreboard that can be displayed. The scores are stored in an .ini file. At the
                        moment the scores are not updated. I used a lot of time (3+ hours) to get this working. First I
                        struggled to find a way to store the scoreboard
                        to be read from the Scoreboard object. My knowledge of passing by reference really affected the
                        time. I kept passing on pointers to store in vectors to be read. However, when I would change to
                        the next line of the .ini file it
                        would change all the values in the vectors. This has made me learn about being careful of
                        passing by reference and pointer. The next issue I had was that the way I was storing the
                        highscores was creating memory leaks. I ended up
                        having to completely redo how the highscores were stored. The game object now stores the
                        highscores and can be accessed by the Scoreboard object.
