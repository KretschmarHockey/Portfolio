                    <h3><b>Django Tree App</b></h3>
                </div>

                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        For Contemporary Issues in Software Engineering paper, we created a tree purchasing store. My
                        job was to create the shopping cart functionality of the web app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was my first experience using python, so I really struggled to get going. Django has an
                        admin database that works very well with shopping cart systems. All of the items are stored on
                        the database. Each of the 'Add to Cart' buttons contains the id of the tree. This is then stored
                        in the logged in users shopping cart.

                    <h3><b>Named Entity Recognition</b></h3>
                </div>

                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        For Text and Vision Intelligence paper, we created a named entity recognition script. This reads
                        TXT files in a folder and then saves the output as each file in different two folders. The first
                        folder has a list of all the entities by category. The second folder has a list of all the
                        entities with the category tag next to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was achieved using the NLTK package. Once the files are read in, all the words are
                        tokenized and then tagged on the words part of speech. The nouns are then chunked into noun
                        phrases which are also tagged by entity recognition. With the test data the accuracy was 68.33%
                    </p>

                    <h3><b>Spam Detection</b></h3>
                </div>

                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        For Data Mining and Knowledge Engineering paper, we tested spam detection classifiers. This was
                        done using the enron email corpus dataset. We needed lots of different options for training and
                        testing our models.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We had two options for spliting the training and testing data. Either randomly splitting the
                        emails
                        into training and testing data, or using certain folders as training and testing data. We then
                        had three different models to be trained. Naive Bayes, Neural Network or a Logistic Regression
                        model.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The output of the program prints out the confusion matrix, classification report and accuracy of
                        each model. Our most accurate model was the Neural Network when we randomly split the training
                        and test data with 98.25% accuracy. Our worst performing model was the Neural Network when we
                        chose specific folders for the training and testing data with 57.10% accuracy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was achieved using the NLTK package for pre-processing the unstructured data. We also used
                        the sklearn package for vectorizing the words, randomly splitting the training and testing data,
                        and using and analyzing the models.
